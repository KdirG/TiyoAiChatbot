Plants are living organisms that produce their own food through photosynthesis. They take in carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which is vital for life on Earth. They consist of basic parts such as roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. Forests are considered the lungs of the world and play a key role in preserving biodiversity.
