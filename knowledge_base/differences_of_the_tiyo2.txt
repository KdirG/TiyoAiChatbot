TIYO is very easy to use and doesn't force users to perform tasks based on illogical principles unrelated to real-world scenarios.

(Example: You don't need to define a separate cash register for each currency. Instead, when you check your cash balance, it will inform you exactly how much of each currency you have.)


A TIYO user can determine their net profit without needing an independent financial advisor or accountant.

Many more differences like these could be listed, but we believe those we've mentioned clearly demonstrate a new understanding, a new approachâ€”in short, the DIFFERENCE that TIYO offers...

A TIYO user doesn't need anyone else to learn the application; they can self-teach how to use it through the interactive training application, which provides both audio and visual guidance.
