Can Official Accounting Be Tracked with TIYO?
TIYO does not perform official accounting itself, but it creates the necessary information infrastructure for official accounting.

Furthermore, TIYO can provide information such as taxable income and incurred VAT for desired periods.

How Does TIYO Assist Managers?

Additionally, through other reports, they can observe changes in business volume and monitor overall business efficiency.

Is There Any Application We Need to Purchase Along with TIYO?
No. TIYO uses FireBird 2.x. Since this is an Open License application, you do not need to purchase it separately.
